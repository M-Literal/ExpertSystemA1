For this program to function correctly if you are running the system from the command line, you need to install pandas and PySimpleGUI.


PySimpleGUI installation instructions:

The A1_JamesH_JustinR.py file is the code for the expert system. However, in the A1_JamesH_JustinR_Executable_Directory file, you will find the A1_JamesH_JustinR.exe file that should be able to run the code on any PC without even installing python. Simply launch that file and it should run without issues.
