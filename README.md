# ExpertSystemA1

The A1_JamesH_JustinR.py file is the code for the expert system. However, in the A1_JamesH_JustinR_Executable_Directory file, you will find the A1_JamesH_JustinR.exe file that should be able to run the code on any PC without even installing python. Simply launch that file and it should run without issues.
 
However, if there are any issues running the executable file, you can run the code on command line, but you must install pandas and PySimpleGUI.


PySimpleGUI installation instructions:
